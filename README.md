# Task : Creating a Simple Flutter App

Begin by opening Visual Studio Code and creating a new Flutter application.

In the main.dart file, delete all the existing code.

Add a main method and a MyApp class to the main.dart file. The main method should include the runApp method, passing an object of the MyApp class to run the app.

Inside the MyApp class, implement the build method and add a MaterialApp widget.

Create a new file named home_page.dart in the lib/pages folder to hold the code for the home page.

In the home_page.dart file, add a Scaffold widget as the root widget and create other widgets as shown in the image below.

Finally, set the home widget of MaterialApp in the main.dart file to HomePage.
